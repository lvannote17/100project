# 100project

This project imports a .csv file containing data on greenhouse emissions and sustainability
of various foods. Using this data as a template, synthetic data is produced according to 
a gamma distribution using Faker. This data is then used to create a sustainability ranking
(on a scale of 100) based on the number of standard deviations data is from the mean. The user 
is able to see the ranking for a given food name input. 

Library imports may be found within the file.
